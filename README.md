# Knowledge Graph: STEM Research Center Best Practices

This repository contains a Python-based tool to visualize best practices in a STEM research center using a structured knowledge graph. The graph highlights thematic clusters, weighted relationships, and feedback mechanisms across key activities like recruitment, retention, engagement, and assessment.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

The graph maps ten evidence-based best practices developed over five years of research into three strategic objectives:
- **Recruit Broadly**
- **Retain and Reward Participants**
- **Engage Faculty, Students, and Community**

Each cluster is color-coded, and relationships are labeled and weighted to reflect influence and feedback.

## ðŸ—‚ Files

- `graph_generator.py`: Main Python script to generate and save the graphs.
- `knowledge_graph_with_text.png`: Labeled graph with full node and edge annotations.
- `knowledge_graph_no_labels.png`: Clean version for overlay or design use.
- `layout_positions.pkl`: Stores a fixed graph layout for consistent outputs.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

```bash
pip install networkx matplotlib

ðŸš€ How to Run
bash
CopyEdit
python graph_generator.py
This will generate two PNGs (with and without labels) using a stable layout saved in layout_positions.pkl.

ðŸ§  Highlights
â€¢	Uses networkx for directed graph creation
â€¢	Visualizes weights, edge labels, and thematic clusters
â€¢	Includes a clean legend with flexible layout and color coding
â€¢	Designed for reproducibility and clarity
