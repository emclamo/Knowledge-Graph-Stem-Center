# Knowledge Graph: STEM Research Center Best Practices

This project visualizes ten best practices developed over five years by a STEM research center. The graph highlights three strategic objectivesâ€”**Recruit**, **Retain**, and **Engage**â€”and shows how practices relate through directional, weighted connections and thematic clusters.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- **Recruit Broadly**
- **Retain and Reward Participants**
- **Engage Faculty, Students, and Community**
- **Assess and Calibrate Continuously**

Each practice is represented as a node, color-coded by cluster. Arrows reflect directional influence and are labeled with qualitative relationships (e.g., _supports_, _informs_, _reinforces_).
